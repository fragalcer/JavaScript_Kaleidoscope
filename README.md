# COMP1720 lab 5 template

Here's the template for your lab 5 kaleidoscope. See the lab 5 page for
more information:

<https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp1720/labs/05-kaleidoscope/>

## Use

1. clone this repository somewhere

2. open the folder in Atom and start the atom live server (`Packages >
   atom-live-server > Start server` or `Ctrl+Alt+L`)

3. in Chrome, type `localhost:3000` into the address bar to run/view the sketch
   (you might not need to do this---the live server should open the browser
   automatically)

4. every time you save the `sketch.js` file, the live server will auto-update
   the sketch in Chrome

### Notes

This should work in all browsers, but we'll be using Chrome/Chromium in the
labs, so it's probably best to use that.

Also, if you do make a cool sketch, don't push the changes back up to the
"template" repo (you probably don't have permission to do that anyway). Instead,
create a new GitLab repo and push it up there.
